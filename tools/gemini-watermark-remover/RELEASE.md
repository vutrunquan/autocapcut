# Release Checklist

## Scope

This repository currently ships four release surfaces:

- website build in `dist/`
- userscript bundle in `dist/userscript/gemini-watermark-remover.user.js`
- package/sdk source and metadata from `package.json`, `src/core/`, and `src/sdk/`
- Chrome Web Store listing plus its root-manifest upload package in `release/gemini-watermark-remover-extension-web-store-v<version>.zip`, and the manual fallback package in `release/gemini-watermark-remover-extension-v<version>.zip`

## Preflight

Run these locally from the repo root:

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm release:preflight
```

For an image-scoped release, refresh evidence with `pnpm release:image-validation` and `pnpm release:image-evidence`. The quality gate runs `pnpm release:image-quality-gate`, records the internal comparison gate as a claim audit, and then runs `pnpm release:readiness -- --scope image-defaults --fail-on-not-ready`.

Expected result:

- all tests pass
- website artifacts in `dist/` are regenerated for the current build
- `dist/userscript/gemini-watermark-remover.user.js` is regenerated
- package/sdk entrypoints in `package.json` still match the published source layout
- generated userscript metadata uses the current `package.json` version
- Chrome Web Store upload zip, manual fallback zip, their sha256 files, and `latest-extension.json` are regenerated in `release/`
- the image evidence gate is current; the internal comparison gate may keep broad V2/video claims blocked without blocking the scoped image release
- `pnpm release:preflight` runs `pnpm build`, `pnpm test`, `pnpm package:extension`, `pnpm release:quality-gate`, `pnpm release:goal-audit -- --fail-on-incomplete`, and `pnpm release:ci-check` in order
- `pnpm release:quality-gate` verifies pinned image evidence, runs the internal comparison gate as a claim audit, then runs scoped readiness
- `pnpm release:goal-audit` reports `goal achieved: yes` for the scoped RC objective
- `pnpm release:ci-check` verifies the GitHub Actions CI run for the current `HEAD`; if no completed successful run exists, release preflight fails closed and prints the failing job/log summary
- broader video quality claims remain blocked unless the video gates are promoted
- release readiness reports `rc-current-image-defaults-with-scoped-claims` before publishing a scoped image RC
- release notes follow the `Release Claim Matrix`: publish only `allowed`, `allowed-scoped`, or `allowed-safety-only` rows, and keep `review-only`, `experiment-only`, and `forbidden` rows out of public capability claims
- the unpacked extension in `dist/extension` is a local test build; the official release manifest is written only into the zip in `release/`

## Scoped 1.0.44 Video Fix

Use `pnpm release:video-fix-preflight` for the reviewed #157 candidate-selection fix only. Keep the image-defaults gate unchanged. Run build/full tests on CI; for local acceptance of CI outputs use `pnpm release:video-fix-gate -- --integration-dir <reviewed-evidence-directory> --tgz-path <CI-package.tgz> --latest-extension <CI-latest-extension.json>`.

This gate pins v1.0.43 and the reviewed source tree, reuses unchanged image evidence as historical evidence, verifies frozen video review/output hashes, and downloads the successful current-HEAD CI artifacts to compare package and extension bytes. Supply the preserved `ordinary-browser` evidence directory; missing evidence must fail. New code requires new successful CI and matching artifacts. Passing covers this scoped core candidate, not general video quality or the separate website deployment. Website browser checks, including WebKit, remain required for its release.

When committing accepted release artifacts, preserve their build identity in `release/evidence/v1.0.44-video-build.json`. The video gate compares all production inputs and package metadata with that build commit, verifies its successful CI run, and downloads its original artifacts for comparison. It also requires successful CI for the final HEAD. This permits artifact-only release commits without pretending the bytes were rebuilt at that commit.

## Public Release Wording

- Keep public notes focused on user-visible fixes, supported release surfaces, and scoped capability claims.
- Do not mention internal benchmark names, implementation research notes, or unshipped comparison claims in public release notes.
- For the current gate result, describe video cleanup as review-scoped or experimental unless a later gate explicitly promotes it.
- Do not call the build a full stable/general-availability release while readiness still reports `rc-current-image-defaults-with-scoped-claims`.

## Release Metadata

- bump `package.json` version
- keep `build.js` userscript `@version` sourced from `pkg.version`
- add dated entries to `CHANGELOG.md` and `CHANGELOG_zh.md`

## Manual Verification

- install or update the generated userscript in Tampermonkey/Violentmonkey
- run `pnpm probe:tm:freshness` against the fixed profile when validating the local install
- verify Gemini page preview replacement works
- verify native Gemini copy/download still returns processed output
- verify preview processing failure leaves the original page image visible
- load the unpacked local Chrome extension from `dist/extension` and verify the popup toggle, Gemini online link, general watermark link, and GitHub feedback link; confirm the extension card is labeled `Gemini Watermark Remover Local`
- verify the live Chrome Web Store listing points to:
  `https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/gemini-watermark-remover/cjlmnfcfnofnglkphbcdclbpimdjkmdf`
- if you publish the sdk surface, run a final package smoke check before uploading

## Publish

- commit release changes
- create a git tag matching the package version, for example `v1.0.1`
- create a GitHub Release from that tag and upload the built userscript from `dist/userscript/gemini-watermark-remover.user.js`
- upload `release/gemini-watermark-remover-extension-v<version>.zip`, its `.sha256.txt` file, and `latest-extension.json` to GitHub Release as the manual fallback package
- submit `release/gemini-watermark-remover-extension-web-store-v<version>.zip` to Chrome Web Store; its `manifest.json` is at the archive root as required by the store
- publish the sdk package only if this release includes package-facing changes

## Downstream Dependency Sync

- Check downstream projects for a direct package dependency before bumping them:
  `rg -n "@pilio/gemini-watermark-remover" --glob package.json --glob pnpm-lock.yaml`
- Do not treat task routes, processor keys, i18n copy, tests, or docs mentioning `gemini-watermark-remover` as evidence that the npm SDK must be bumped.
- Only update a downstream project when it directly depends on `@pilio/gemini-watermark-remover`.
- If a separate public website consumes the npm SDK, update that site's `package.json` / `pnpm-lock.yaml`, then rebuild, test, and deploy the site.

Example GitHub Release command:

```bash
gh release create v<version> \
  dist/userscript/gemini-watermark-remover.user.js \
  release/gemini-watermark-remover-extension-v<version>.zip \
  release/gemini-watermark-remover-extension-v<version>.zip.sha256.txt \
  release/latest-extension.json \
  --repo GargantuaX/gemini-watermark-remover \
  --title "v<version>" \
  --notes "<release notes>" \
  --latest
```

## Official Website Sync

If you maintain a separate public website for the project, sync it after the GitHub Release is published:

1. Run the website's userscript build/sync command.
   - This rebuilds this upstream repository.
   - It copies `dist/userscript/gemini-watermark-remover.user.js` to `public/userscript/gemini-watermark-remover.user.js`.
2. If the npm SDK was published for this release and the website still directly depends on it, update `@pilio/gemini-watermark-remover` to the released version and refresh `pnpm-lock.yaml`.
3. Download the exact Chrome extension fallback assets from the GitHub Release into the website project:
   - `gemini-watermark-remover-extension-v<version>.zip`
   - `gemini-watermark-remover-extension-v<version>.zip.sha256.txt`
   - `latest-extension.json`
4. Copy those files to `public/downloads/`.
5. Update `src/i18n/chrome-extension-content.ts` to keep the primary Chrome extension CTA pointed at the Chrome Web Store and the fallback package metadata matched to `latest-extension.json`.
6. Remove stale older extension zip and checksum files from `public/downloads/`.
7. Run `pnpm test` and `pnpm run build` in the website project.
8. Deploy with `pnpm run deploy:cf-workers`.
9. Back in this repository, run `pnpm release:distribution-check` and keep the generated report as the source of truth for release surface status.

`pnpm run deploy:cf-workers` may finish the Cloudflare deployment successfully and then report a Sentry release finalization error. If Wrangler prints a current version ID and the live site verifies correctly, treat the website deployment as published, then investigate Sentry separately.

## Post-Release

- confirm `pnpm release:distribution-check` reports `ok` for local package, GitHub Release, release assets, npm latest, website userscript, website `latest-extension.json`, and website extension zip
- if the only remaining item is `chrome-web-store-update: waiting`, treat the release as distributed everywhere except Chrome Web Store propagation/review; keep the release open only for store follow-up
- confirm the installed userscript reports the expected version
- confirm the GitHub Release latest userscript serves the latest bundle:
  `https://github.com/GargantuaX/gemini-watermark-remover/releases/latest/download/gemini-watermark-remover.user.js`
- confirm the official website serves the latest userscript bundle:
  `https://geminiwatermarkremover.io/userscript/gemini-watermark-remover.user.js`
- confirm the Chrome Web Store listing is reachable:
  `https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/gemini-watermark-remover/cjlmnfcfnofnglkphbcdclbpimdjkmdf`
- confirm the official website points the primary Chrome extension CTA to Chrome Web Store and still serves the latest fallback zip with matching checksum
- confirm `https://geminiwatermarkremover.io/downloads/latest-extension.json` reports the latest extension version, file, size, and sha256
- update the GitHub Release notes and any directly addressed GitHub issues with the shipped version, verification evidence, and any remaining propagation caveat
- keep any ad hoc verification notes in the release PR or tag notes, not in source docs
